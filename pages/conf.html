                            <p class="card-text">Since the start of the Syrian Civil War on March 15, 2011, thousands have died, the country has been torn apart, and millions have suffered. Even after 11 years, the Syrian refugee crisis continues to be the biggest in the entire globe. More than half of the nation's population, or 13.4 million people, are in need of humanitarian assistance and protection
                                According to U.N. roles, a conference was held to discuss this problem and find a lot of solutions for the protection of refugees from the war Because, ultimately, citizens have nothing to do with the political problems going on in the country.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">Every day more and more children go to bed hungry. In Yemen, 2.2 million children suffer from malnutrition. A hospital employee describes the scene as horrifying, saying that the children "look like skeletons". The situation is not getting better, conversely, the situation in Yemen is deteriorating rapidly, with 16 million people marching toward starvation and millions at risk of death 
                                World Food Program and the United Nations, the impact is far more devastating than they can handle. The economic crisis, a byproduct of the civil war, has pushed food prices to their highest level since 2015 in 2021, leaving low- and middle-income Yemenis unable to afford basic food items. 
                                Yemen depends on her 30% of its wheat imports from Ukraine, along with the Ukraine war which has led to a significant increase in food prices.
                                So we had to hold a meeting to solve this problem, and we really did come up with more than one solution.</p>
